## 🎨 Key Design Decisions

- **Color Scheme**: React Blue (#61DAFB) vs Vue Green (#42b883) for clear visual distinction
- **Typography**: Inter for UI, JetBrains Mono for code examples
- **Animations**: Subtle transitions using @vueuse/motion for better UX
- **Code Display**: Monaco Editor for familiar VS Code experience
- **Layout**: Side-by-side comparisons to highlight differences
- **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML, proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation
